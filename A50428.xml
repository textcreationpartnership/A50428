            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Chriſtians of the firſt Ages were ſuch Ornaments of their Profeſſion, and ſuch Examples of Piety and Zeal, of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Patience, and all other Vertues, that the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them with aſtoniſhment. Many of their Enemies conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſo heavenly a Converſation proceeded from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that is more than Human, and were thereby induced to embrace the Goſpel of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> But it muſt be acknowledged, that there were many that aſſum'd the Name of Chriſtians, who, by their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Hereſies and deteſtable Practices, caus'd the Way of Truth to be blaſphem'd. Yet

They pretended, that they underſtood more than <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> or any other Mortal; and that they were no more polluted with the Sins they committed than Gold was diminiſhed in its Subſtance or corrupted with Dirt.</p>
            <p>I know not whether any amongſt us be arriv'd to ſuch Arrogance and Folly: But it is too evident, and it is ſad to conſider, that as there is no ſmall number of debauch'd and profligate Wretches, even in theſe Times of ſo much Light, who ſet their Mouths againſt Heaven, and, like the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Antiochus,</hi> ſpeak <hi>marvellous things against the God of Gods:</hi> So there are many others, that profeſs to know God, but in Works deny him, and to have a ſpecial intereſt in the favour of Chriſt, but hate to be reform'd by him. They flatter themſelves into a belief, that they have made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with him of their Sins, which nevertheleſs they reſolve not to part with for his Righteouſneſs, which they are willing he ſhould keep to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They are not concern'd about it, nor are they ſolicitous to know, whether the advantageous Bargain, with which they are ſo much affected, have any other ground but in their own imagination: Becauſe a juſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into this Matter would fruſtrate their great Deſign, which is, to live wickedly and as comfortably as they can, and to reconcile their Vices with the hopes of Salvation.</p>

               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:95608:3"/>This diſpoſes them to advance or defend ſuch Doctrines as are moſt ſuitable to their corrupt Inclinations: and from hence it is, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bringing their Actions to the Rule, they warp the Rule into a compliance with their Actions: Or, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks

            </p>
            <p>Amongſt all the parts of the Holy Scripture that have been thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, I think none have ſuffer'd more than St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles; in which, as another Apoſtle aſſures us, there <hi>are ſome things hard to be underſtood,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16. And ſuch are the things which Men of corrupt minds are wont to ſet upon the <hi>Rack</hi>

            <p>For this purpoſe, they ſerve themſelves of the ſeventh Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and they ſeem to me to argue more plauſibly from thence, in vindication of Impiety, than from any other part of the Apoſtle's Writings: Which may ſhew, what care we ought to take to inform ourſelves of his meaning, that we may avoid their Miſtakes, of which both the Cauſes and Effects are very deplorable; and be able to defend Chriſtianity from their Aſſaults and the Reproaches that they would caſt upon it.

            <p>Indeed, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf in the ſtate of Sanctification, where he ſays, that he is <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>ſold under Sin,</hi> with other things of the like nature, a Man may then at once be engaged in the Service of <hi>God and Mammon,</hi> and be in <hi>Communion both with Christ and Belial.</hi> He may reconcile things that are moſt inconſiſtent, and be at the ſame time a Child of <hi>Light</hi> and of <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> He need but ſay, <hi>The Evil I do, I allow not; and therefore it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me;</hi> and this would juſtifie the greateſt Enormities. To know his Maſter's Will, and not to do it; to confeſs it to be holy, juſt and good, and
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:95608:3"/>to be under convictions from it, and yet to neglect it, would ſecure him from future ſtripes for his diſobedience to it. And to bite the Chain that holds him faſt, and to fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

To violate the Laws of God with reluctancy and againſt the dictates of his own Conſcience, would be a mark of Sanctification: and of this Conſolation he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be depriv'd, unleſs he loſt all ſence of good and evil, and, being <hi>past feeling,</hi> ruſh'd furiouſly into Sin, without any conſideration or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Divine Vengeance.</p>
            <p>If theſe be juſt and natural Inferences from the Interpretation which I have mention'd, as I think they are, this is cauſe enough to reject it. For they that are skill'd in the Art of Reaſoning lay this down as a Maxim

<note n="†" place="margin">Luke 6.44.</note> That <hi>the Tree is known by its own Fruit:</hi> A Rule that is very applicable to our preſent Caſe, and may ſhew, that it cannot be a good Expoſition that brings forth Conſequences which are evil and pernicious; but ought to be condemn'd, as contrary to the Purity of God, the Deſign of Chriſt, the Work of Grace and the Doctrin of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I deny not, that ſome learned and good Men have been of opinion, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here diſcourſes of himſelf after converſion. But then they tell us, that the Evil, he complains of, was only the motion of concupiſcence, to which he did not conſent, much leſs did he reduce it to practice. Or elſe, they ſay, he meant it not of great or wilful Sins, but only of ſmaller Offences or Infirmities, which in this Life are incident to the Regenerate. And it is true, that (if they have a right notion of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities) by ſoftning the Interpretation in this manner, they have avoided the Conſequences on which I have already reflected. But through unwarineſs or inadvertency, they have done violence to the words of the Apoſtle by that Expoſition. For from his words it is plain, that whoſoever was here ſpoken of, his Condition was very miſerable. Not only an inclination to Sin, but actual and known Sin, had taken poſſeſſion of him and <hi>dwelt</hi> in him, which intimates to us, that it was become habitual, and govern'd

By the way, it may be noted in general, that there are ſeveral Difficulties in this Apoſtle's Writings that we ſhould not find inſuperable, if, with a due application of mind, we would enquire into their Nature and Original. For example, It may be conſider'd, that ſome of theſe Difficulties proceed from his Language; for however that be <hi>Greek,</hi> and therefore may be thought, on that account, not leſs intelligible than any other part of the New Teſtament: Yet ſometimes he uſes words in ſuch a way or ſignification as differs from the conſtruction which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly receive in the Books of other Writers. And, if we may believe a great Judge in ſuch things, he retains ſomething in his ſtyle of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of a <hi>Cilician,</hi> and of an <hi>Hebrew of Hebrews,</hi> and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of <hi>Gamaliel</hi>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IN my first Addreſs to thee I make a ſolemn Profeſſion, That I ſerve no Party of Men; neither can I ſee any worldly Interest that I can promote in the Writing of this Treatiſe, but rather the contrary; and if I had not hoped it might be of ſome uſe to the Publick, I ſhould not have troubled my ſelf in the Compoſing, nor thee in the Peruſing of it; and having ſaid thus much, I ſhall ſhew thee first the Occaſion, and then the Reaſons of my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion was this: I have for theſe Thirty Years and more kept my Thoughts ſuſpended in the Controverſie of Election and Reprobation, and the Liberty of Man's Will, not without making Enquiry by Reading, Diſcourſing and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, with all which I have joyned ſerious Prayer: But I was very loath to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my Thoughts without a clearneſs and evidence. At last, obſerving the Claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was in Books, and in the Pulpit by one against the other, the Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Feuds raiſed in the Parties, the Intricacy of the Knots, and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſeneſs of the Diſcourſes upon this Subject, as they lye in Controverſal Writers, I thought the ſafest, quietest and ſurest way was to endeavour to find out the Truth as it lay in the Scripture alone, and by it ſelf; and to this end I taskt my ſelf to commit to my Memory all the first Eleven Chapters of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> for in the ninth and eleventh Chapters of that Epiſtle is the chief Seat of this Controverſie; and I was willing to learn all the Chapters before, that ſo I might obſerve as warily and curiouſly as I could (begging God's aſſiſtance) how the Apoſtle made his Approaches to that great Myſtery of Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation (which (eſpecially in the ninth Chapter) hath been made the Riſe and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of dreadful Diſputes) for that I did not queſtion but this wiſe Maſter-builder
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:95608:6"/>did raiſe this high and lofty Superſtructure of his ninth and eleventh Chapters upon a ſure Baſis; and though I know that an Epiſtle may contain diſtinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that may have no great (if any) connexion and dependance; yet it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious to any Obſerver, that the most diſputative and argumentative part of the ninth Chapter hath a clear relation to and connexion with the third and fourth Chapters foregoing, wherein the Apoſtle is proving Juſtification by Faith, <hi>Rom. 9.30, 31, 32.</hi> What ſhall we ſay then? that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which followed not after Righteouſneſs, have attained to Righteouſneſs, even the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith: But <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs. Wherefore? Becauſe they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law. And this was the reaſon of their reprobation: So that the Election of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſome few <hi>Jews,</hi> was really grounded upon their cleaving to the way of the Promiſe and Faith, whereas the reprobation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was, as I have ſaid, from the contrary reaſon. And accordingly Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> concludes his Paraphraſe upon the ninth Chapter with theſe words: <hi>The Sum then of this whole Chapter will be reduced to theſe five Heads, 1. The Priviledges of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and among them eſpecially Chriſt's being born of that ſtock. 2. That thoſe of them which reſiſted and believed not in Chriſt, were delivered up to obduration by God, and the</hi> Gentiles <hi>taken in their ſtead. 3. That 'twas moſt juſt with God to deal thus with them. 4. That ſome of the</hi> Jews <hi>at that time believed in Chriſt. 5. That the cauſe that the reſt believed not was, that after a Phariſaical manner, they ſought Juſtification by the Works of the Law, Circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>deſpiſing the Faith and Doctrine of Chriſt, and that Evangelical way of Juſtification, and ſo ſtumbling at the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which they ſhould have believed, were the worſe for him, and the preaching of the Apoſtles, by whom they ſhould have been ſo much the better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I bleſs God, in about half a Year's time, I picked up ſo many ſpare Hours as in which I obtained what I deſigned, the getting by heart thoſe eleven Chapters, and have repeated them often exactly; and in the getting of them, and at last my ninth and eleventh, I have attained a very comfortable Satisfaction in the Controverſie about Election and Reprobation, and do not at all repent any Hour's time ſpent in the endeavour with relation to that. But that which I have now to acquaint thee with is, That while I was making my Progreſs in getting and repeating the ſeveral Chapters, there did a conſiderable light ariſe to me concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true and genuine ſence of the ſeventh Chapter, which I had been often puzzelled about heretofore. And this I thought worthy a new Labour to acquaint thee with, ſo here I have given thee the occaſion of my writing upon it.</p>
            <p>Now for my Reaſons moving me ſo to do, take as followeth:</p>
            <p>

<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>I</label> I have obſerved, That ſeveral Expreſſions in that ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Romans</hi> are the common ſhelter of many profligate Perſons, who would fain paſs in their own apprehenſions, and in the judgment of others, for good
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:95608:6"/>Men, though if they would make any ſerious Reflections, they must needs ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a very evil ſtate. <hi>When I would do good,</hi> ſay they, <hi>evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me; the good that I would I do not, and the evil that I would not do that I do; ſo then it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me. With my mind I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God, but with my fleſh the Law of Sin:</hi> And ſo lick themſelves whole preſently after every the foulest Commiſſion, With an, <hi>O wretched Man that I am!</hi> and all becauſe it is allowed by ſome, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed theſe Expreſſions as ſpeaking in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon after converſion.

And yet they are not forced to acknowledge, that <hi>they are ſold under ſin,</hi> as the Expreſſion in that ſeventh to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which they put a Sword into all wicked perſons hands to kill themſelves withal, and to bear themſelves out in their vileſt Enormities.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the fourth Chapter he proves Juſtification by Faith, by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Example, and <hi>David</hi>'s Deſcription of the Bleſſedneſs of a Man, any Man.</p>
            <p>In the fifth Chapter he inſtitutes a Compariſon betwixt the hurt done to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and the benefit to Mankind by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and heighthens the benefit unſpeakably beyond the loſs, <hi>That as ſin hath reigned unto death, ſo grace reigns by righteouſneſs unto eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> And ſo concludes the Diſcourſe of Juſtification by Faith.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth Chapter the Apoſtle comes to a new Subject, which takes up that and the ſeventh and a good part of the eighth Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhews, that that is as neceſſarily dependant and conſequent upon Faith and Grace, as Juſtification it ſelf is.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh Chapter, after the Apoſtle had ſetled the matter of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſixth, as indiſpenſibly neceſſary and naturally flowing from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace and Juſtification by Faith, he is pleaſed, according to the Wiſdom given to him, to bring in an Inſtance of an Ineffectual Attempt towards Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by a Man under Convictions from the Law, as he had before ſhewn at large, the folly of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians,</hi> in ſeeking Juſtification by the Law; and indeed he words the matter in a way of perſonation in his own perſon: whereupon ſeveral have miſtaken the Apoſtle's deſign, thinking that he ſpake all thoſe things of himſelf after he was converted, and in an eſtate of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, whereas it is very clear to me, and indeed I find to many learned and godly Men, that the Apoſtle is only in his own Perſon perſonating a Man that is not truly converted, but ſtrugling with his Corruptions in his own ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terrified by the Law, which only convinceth of Sin, and is a miniſtration of Condemnation; and ſo no wonder that he is ſo overcome and brought into Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:95608:9"/>as he acknowledgeth himſelf to be in that Chapter. But this I ſpeak here but precariouſly, till I ſhall afterwards have made it to appear.</p>
            <p>In the eighth Chapter, the Apoſtle, after he had ſet forth the convinced Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in ſuch a ſtruggle with his Corruptions in his own Strength, (the Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording him neither Strength nor Hope) after he had ſet him forth as overcome and captivated, and brought into deſperation, he gives him a glimpſe of Christ, gives him a Plank after his Shipwreck, and in the very latter end of the ſeventh and beginning of the eighth Chapter, brings him off clear from thoſe Rocks and Shelves upon which he had been in utmost danger of periſhing.

It is a perfect contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their being dead to it, to live in it. This is a Paraphraſe and Comment enough for the ſecond Verſe.</p>

                  </gap> a plain Alluſion made to the ancient way of Baptizing, which was by dipping under Water, called here burying, and riſing or being raiſed up. I ſhall give this Explication in the Words of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> upon the Text, the third and fourth Verſes:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>'Tis a thing, ſaith he, that every Chriſtian knows, that the Innerſion in Baptiſm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the Death of Chriſt; the putting the Perſon baptized into the Water, denotes and proclaims the Death and Burial of Chriſt, and ſignifies our undertaking in Baptiſm, that we will give over all the Sins of our former Lives, (which is our being buried together with Chriſt, or baptized to his Death) that ſo we may live that regenerate new Life (anſwerable to Chriſt's Reſurrection) which conſiſts in a Courſe of all Sanctity, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Chriſtian Walk all our days.</q> This is enough for Explication.</p>
               <p>Now the Argumentation of the Apoſtle ſeems to lye here: A Chriſtian, by his Profeſſion, is not only dead to Sin, but he is buried too, and riſen to a new Life; and therefore 'tis abſurd and monſtrous to ſee him live in any Sin, as terrible, monſtrous, abſurd and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, as it were for us that have buried our Friends with all proper Solemnities, to ſee them again come to our Houſes, and haunt us from Room to Room, and appear to us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we go or abide; this were enough to frighten us out of our Life: Even ſo monſtrous and horrible a thing would it ſeem to us, if we had the ſence of ſpiritual things, as we have of natural, to ſee any Man, that profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſtian, to live in any known Sin. But what an Age do we live in, and how abſurd (I had almoſt ſaid) is this Doctrine now! How ſtrangely ſounding in our Ears! Where the Profeſſor, that endeavoars to live as one dead and buried unto Sin, looks rather like a Spectre or Ghoſt, than a Man that proclaims his Sin as <hi>Sodom!</hi> But let us leave the Age, and return to the Apoſtle and to the Rule.</p>

For he is apt to take it thus, Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you ſhould obey it (that is ſin) in the luſts thereof, that is, in the luſts of ſin; but it is not ſo, but quite otherwiſe in the Greek, in the luſts thereof, that is, of the body. I ſhall endeavour to explain the matter thus, for it is not a meer Nicety, but the Obſervation or Criticiſm carries a great deal of uſeful ſence in it; We are all of us here in this World in a mortal body <hi>(Whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell, God knoweth,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Poul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2.

Now the Apoſtle's advice is, that ſin reign not in our mortal bodies. In the body of ſin, (which is to be deſtroyed and crucified with Chriſt) there is nothing elſe but ſin, reigning ſin; this therefore muſt be deſtroyed: but it is no duty, but a great ſin, for us to deſtroy and kill our mortal body; we muſt nouriſh it and cheriſh it in a moderate way, only we muſt have a care that ſin reign not in theſe mortal bodies, ſo as to obey ſin, in gratifying to exceſs the innocent luſtings or deſires of our body.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>14</label> Here the Apoſtle expreſſes the great reaſon why true Chriſtians may be and are freed from the dominion of ſin, it is becauſe they are not under the Law, and ſeek not to be juſtified by the Law, but under Grace, Juſtification and Sanctification, have one and the ſame Root, Source and Foundation, <hi>Jeſus Christ is made of God unto us wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.

               <p>I ſhall need here to ſay ſomething to make it appear how the Dominion of Sin is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Grace, and not by the Law, though I know I ſhall have much more occaſion ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times to ſpeak to this in the ſeventh Chapter, which indeed cannot be made intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible without the unfolding of this Myſtery: And firſt for the explication of it I ſhall give a parallel place, it is <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16, 18. Verſe 16. <hi>This I ſay then, walk in the ſpirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh.</hi> Verſe 18. <hi>If ye be led by the ſpirit, ye are not under the law.</hi> The Apoſtle had before been exhorting them to love one another, becauſe Love was the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95608:12"/>fulfilling of the Law, and tells them further, in Verſe 15. <hi>If they did bite and devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> there was a great danger <hi>they would be conſumed one of another.</hi> Now, for prevention hereof, the Apoſtle adds, Verſe 16. <hi>This I ſay then, walk in ſpirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> that is, that luſt of envy and bitterneſs. Verſe 17. <hi>For the fleſh luſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh: and theſe are contrary the one to the other; ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</hi> Even in good Men there is a remainder of fleſh, as it is taken in an ill ſence, which hinders them from doing much of that good which they would fain do, when they are more themſelves: But then the Apoſtle minds them of what he had ſaid before in the ſixteenth Verſe, (as the Apoſtle loves to inculcate and repeat) <hi>If you be led by the ſpirit,</hi> (or walk in the ſpirit, which I take to be all one) <hi>if ye be led by the ſpirit, ye are not under the law.</hi> Which I take to be all one with the other part of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Verſe, <hi>Ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh:</hi> And accordingly he reckons up the luſts of the fleſh, which, when brought into act, are the works of the fleſh.

But the parallel I ſeem to my ſelf to find in theſe words of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> compared with thoſe in <hi>Romans</hi> 6.14. appears thus, in Ep. to <hi>Gal.</hi> tis, <hi>If ye be led by the ſpirit, ye are not under the law;</hi> or ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh; to be under the law, and to fulfil the luſts of the fleſh, are conſequent one upon another, and therefore uſed as ſynonimous or equivalent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; and if ſo, they fully anſwer the words that I am now upon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> Now if not to be under the law, and not to fulfil the luſts of the fleſh, be all one, then to be under the law, and to fulfil the luſts of the fleſh, are all one; for, <hi>Contrariorum contrariae ſunt rationes;</hi> and if to be under the law, and to fulfil the luſts of the fleſh, are all one, that is in the way of inferring one another, as, <hi>Poſita cauſa ponitur effectus,</hi> being under the law is the cauſe, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the luſts of the fleſh is the effect: I ſay, if theſe are all one, or rather if they do, <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo ſe ponere &amp; tollere,</hi> then the Apoſtle's is a good Argument in the Text before us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> But I ſhall leave the Argument from a parallel which ſerves only to prove the <gap reason="foreign">

And here, the poor Man find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it his duty to abſtain from all evil, and do all that is good, and having no ſtrength and no hope, but in the way of perfect unerring obedience, (beſides the making amends and giving ſatisfaction for his paſt ſins) he grows ſad and mad and deſperate, and falls to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning more than ever; whereas the Man that (having been ſtung with the law, terrified in his conſcience with the thunderings and lightnings of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>) hath heard of Chriſt, and grace, mercy and pardon on him; and rich aſſiſtance from him to do all that is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God, and hath thereupon fled to Chriſt and put himſelf under the conduct of grace, to be led by the ſpirit, and to walk in the ſpirit, he is not under the dominion of ſin; he ſees no reaſon to commit iniquity, but infinite reaſon to the contrary; he feels the influence of all the Apoſtle's arguments; he is dead to ſin; he hath been buried in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and riſen with Chriſt in that ordinance; he looks upon his old Man as crucified with Chriſt; he would have the body of ſin utterly deſtroyed; he will ſerve ſin no longer,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95608:12"/>but as Chriſt ever lives to God, ſo would he; he reſolves, in the ſtrength of God, ſin ſhall not reign in his mortal body, but he will yield up all his limbs and members, and ſenſes, and faculties of body and ſoul unto God: <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi>

                  </gap>. We are cancelled to the Law, ſignifieth, ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> the Law is cancelled to us, that being dead wherein we were held, that is, the Law (which was our firſt Husband) being dead where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were held, (or to which we were obliged, as a Wife to a Husband, during his life) <hi>that we ſhould ſerve in newneſs of ſpirit;</hi> that is, according to a free, ingenious, Goſpel-Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love, and not in the oldneſs of the Letter, that is, according to the ſeverity and rigour of the Law, written in Tables of Stone, which was our old and firſt Husband. So that in this <hi>Antapodoſis</hi> or Reddition which is here made by way of Similitude, to the Caſe of an Husband and Wife, I take it we have theſe ſeveral Propoſitions clearly expreſſed or ſtrongly inferrible:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Law is a Man's firſt Husband.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Law is every Man's Husband, that is, his Soul's Husband (till he betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Chriſt by Faith, for there is no middle State, every Man is either under the Law, or under Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law is a rigid and ſevere Husband, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Verſe 6. Wherein we were held, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23, 24. Before Faith came, we were kept under the Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Law had ſet a guard upon us; <hi>ſhut up unto the faith, which ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be revealed;</hi> ſhut up, as it were, in Priſon, in <hi>Salva Cuſtodia,</hi> Verſe 24. <hi>Wherefore the law was our ſchoolmaſter to bring us unto Chriſt;</hi> and a ſevere Schoolmaſter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That whilſt we are under the Law, and before we betake ourſelves to Chriſt by Faith, we can do nothing but Sin. Verſe 5. <hi>For when we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſin which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</hi> Whilſt we are under the Law we are in the Fleſh wholly carnal, and then the motions of Sin did work and nothing but they, and did bring forth Fruit unto Death. This is the Iſſue of our Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, whilſt we ſinners have no other Husband but only the Law.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Law was in very good earneſt ſince killed, as to the condemning power of it, for all Mankind by the Body of Chriſt crucified.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That every Man in the World, where the Goſpel is preached, is declared to be free from the condemnation of the Law, upon condition, that he betake himſelf to Chriſt as an Husband, and a Lord. And this I take to be the greateſt thing in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That till a Man repent and believe this Goſpel, and be joyned to the Lord Chriſt, as one Spirit with him, he can never bring forth fruit unto God. Verſe 4. <hi>Wherefore, my brethren, ye alſo are become dead to the law</hi> (or rather the Law is dead to you) <hi>by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him that is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> This is the Fruit of the New Wedlock, and without this change of State, there can be no ſuch Fruit.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſeverally I take to be included in the Apoſtle's Similitude; and ſo I come to the ſeventh Verſe, wherein the Apoſtle anſwers a terrible Objection, which ſeems to ariſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally againſt what he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall we ſay then?


<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>7</label> is the law ſin? God forbid.</hi> The Objection riſes naturally thus: You have ſaid above, That when we were in the Fleſh, the Motions of Sin which were by the Law, did ſo work as to bring forth Fruit unto Death, and that we need to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Law, even by the death of it as an Husband, that ſo we may ſerve God with a new Spirit, and bring forth Fruit to God, Why what a ſtrange kind of thing do you make the Law to be? <hi>Quod efficit tale est magis tale.</hi> That which is the cauſe of any thing and brings it forth into being, is much more ſuch a thing as that is, which is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and effected by it. What ſhall we ſay then? is the Law Sin or a ſinful thing, or the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95608:14"/>direct cauſe of Sin? This Queſtion or Objection the Apoſtle anſwers with an abhorrence,


<label type="milestone">

                  <hi>God forbid;</hi> and then gives a very ſubſtantial reaſon for it, <hi>Nay, I had not known ſin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> So that it is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, 'tis true, if this bringing forth Fruit unto Death, had been the natural and kindly Effect of the Law as a Cauſe, it would be ſo, it could no be freed from this aſperſion of being a very ſinful thing, nay Sin itſelf in the abſtract: If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Man and the Law meeting together, the natural product of the Law ſhould be Sin, the Law would indeed deſerve the name of ſinful, and of ſin; but it is not the univocal, natural, kindly Product of the Law upon a Man, but the accidental Effect of the Law upon a Sinner: <hi>But ſin taking occaſion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence.</hi> The Law is ſo far from deſerving the name of ſin or ſinful, ſaith the Apoſtle, that <hi>I had not known ſin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> The natural Effect of the Law is firſt to forbid Sin, and to command all that is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, juſt and good; and, in the next place, to diſcover Sin, to convince and condemn the ſinner; which is quite contrary to the promoting, encouraging and producing Sin.</p>
               <p>Well then, having removed Sin far enough away from being the natural Effect of the Law, he comes to ſhew how the Law did occaſionally and accidentally produce Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſin taking occaſion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence,


<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>8</label> for without the law ſin was dead,</hi> or is dead; there is neither of them no Verb ſubſtantive in the Original.</p>
               <p>And here I think it a very fit occaſion to ſet forth this Myſtery, How the Law, through the corruption of our Nature, is accidentally a great provoker to and ſtirrer up of Sin, which I expreſs thus:</p>
               <p>When any Man goes on in his natural Courſe, and lives the common Life of Men in his worldly Occaſions and worldly Delights, he may go on very ſmoothly, and be all alive <hi>(I was alive without the law once)</hi> and well pleaſed with his Condition, eſpecially if the World ſmiles upon him, before he begins to think of another Life, and another World, and a Day of Judgment, when he ſhall be called to account for all the Irregularities, and for all his Talents of Parts and Strength and Wealth and Opportunities of Glorifying God in the World. But when he begins ſeriouſly to think and conſider, that he is a ſinner; that he is under a Law to God in every thing that he doth and ſpeaks and thinks; that he muſt give an Account for every thing that he enjoys, or hath the uſe of; and begins to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he is guilty of many Sins, by way of omiſſion and commiſſion; and that every Sin deſerves Hell, lays him under Wrath and an Eternal Curſe, then here comes the Law in its Convictions, chargeth him with Guilt in one Action and another, and, above all, with a Corrupt Nature, that is the Scource and Fountain of every Irregularity and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and bids him obſerve well and do all things that are written and recorded as his Duty; and tells him he is damn'd if he do not; and tells him he is under a Sentence of Condemnation for every Sin he hath committed; for this is the proper Office of the Law to every ſinner; for it is not to be avoided, but that it ſhould be the Duty of every rational Creature, Man or Angel, to do his Creator's Will, and to avoid the doing of every thing that is contrary thereunto, and when he hath offended he falls under his Maker's diſpleaſure: But this Men do not think upon, till Conſcience begins to work. And this I take to be the Law's coming to a Man. <hi>When the commandment came,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,

A Coward, they ſay, when made deſperate, grows many times very valiant. And this is all the way I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of, how that the Law, that is holy, and juſt and good, can work in a Man all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Concupiſcence.

Law that was made death, but Sin was made death, or became death: Sin, I ſay, that it might appear Sin; that is, that it might appear to be what it was, that it might indeed look like it ſelf, a moſt miſchievous thing indeed.

To bring good out of evil is the work of God, but to bring evil, and the greateſt evil out of the greateſt good, is the work of the Devil, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the work of Sin, that miſchievous thing that firſt made Devils, and then made Hell. Sin, that it might appear Sin, the Apoſtle hath no worſe word, or name to call Sin by, or elſe it ſhould have had ſome other dreadful Epithet.

The latter no doubt. See if any one will be content with this Excuſe in a matter of Theft, or Slander, or Wounds; to ſay, 'Tis not I that ſtole, but my thieviſh Temper; 'tis not I that ſtruck you, but my angry Paſſion; 'twas not I that railed at you, or ſpoke evil falſly of you, but my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate and malicious Tongue; this is a Tale to tell a Child, but not to be believed by a Man, or admitted for an Excuſe in a Court of Juſtice. It is thy angry Perſon that ſtrikes; 'tis thy luſtful Heart that commits lewdneſs; 'tis thy covetous Heart that ſteals and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauds; 'tis thy prophane Heart that blaſphemes: It will be imputed to thy whole Man, what thou doſt with thy Hand or Tongue, or any Member of thy Body; Sin will not be called to account as a Perſon, but the Perſon for the Sin. And therefore, to make a little ſence of the Excuſe here, it can only be this, That a Man under conviction of Sin may ſay indeed, that he doth not ſin with all his heart; that he hath a Conſcience within him that checks him in and for what he doth. But yet if Conſcience cannot reſtrain him from doing evil, nor command him to do the good that he ſhould, that renitency of Conſcience will not excuſe him before God, but he ſhall be condemned as a Criminal at laſt for all his Commiſſions and Omiſſions, if he doth not get beyond this ſtate of Conviction to a ſtate of Converſion; and the renitency and reluctancy of his Conſcience will be ſo far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him, that it will be the higheſt aggravation towards his condemnation.</p>

<label type="milestone">

               <p n="2">2. Here is a quite different Law, never before mentioned, <hi>viz. The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, ſets the perſon free that was captive under the Law of Sin and Death. Now let it be allowed, <hi>(Diſputandi Cauſa)</hi> that the word or perſon (I) all along the ſeventh Chapter was St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet ſure they will not deny that (me,) which is but the Accuſative Caſe of I, is St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95608:17"/>the ſeventh Chapter, though ſpoken of the ſame perſon, is not ſpoken of the ſame perſon in the ſame ſtate here. In the ſeventh Chapter he is led into Captivity to the Law of Sin and Death. In this Chapter the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus hath ſet him free from the Law of Sin and Death. Therefore the Man in the ſeventh Chapter, that was led into captivity to the Law of Sin, Verſe 23. needed the Goſpel (which is here called the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus) to ſet him at liberty from this Law of Sin. Therefore he was before only a miſerable Man under the convictions and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Law, and not converted, which was the thing to be proved. But yet the Apoſtle goes on, and gives a more full account of this matter, which leaves the thing without all pretence of doubt, as I conceive, Ver. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh,

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What was the impoſſible thing which the Law could not do? Why, to juſtifie or ſanctifie a ſinner. How came it impoſſible to the Law, to effect either of theſe? Why, not from any weakneſs in itſelf; it would have juſtified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Man with good authority. But it cannot juſtifie a ſinner, that is impoſſible, for then the Law of God would ceaſe to be holy; it would have ſanctified innocent Man, that is, have led him on from one kind of holy action to another, and made him conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in, and ready at doing the whole Will of God. But when it meets with a ſinner, through the ſin which reigns in his fleſh, it not only condemns him, but irritates and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Luſt, till Sin by the Commandment appear in its colours, appear Sin, and become out of meaſure ſinful, as we have at large diſcourſed this matter in the foregoing Chapter. This argues no weakneſs in the Law, that it cannot juſtifie or ſanctifie a ſinner; for it is weak only through the fleſh. So that any Man that doth not betake himſelf to Chriſt and the Goſpel, but is only under Convictions from the Law, muſt needs be in ſuch a condition as the ſeventh Chapter deſcribes. But now God, in infinite Mercy, (ſince the Law, under which Man was created, was utterly diſabled from juſtifying, much more from ſanctifying fallen Man) ſent his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh; and by ſo ſending him, did that for us which the Law could not do; and for ſin, or as it is in the Margin, by a Sin-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering condemned ſin in the fleſh, that is, expiated our ſins, and ſhewed us a way, how we might effectually ſubdue our luſts; or to give you the Paraphraſe of the Verſe in Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s own words they are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For when through the fleſhly deſires of Men carrying them headlong into all Sin, in deſpight of the Prohibitions of the Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.14. the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was by this means weak, and unable to reform and amend Mens Lives, then moſt ſeaſonably God ſent his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, that is, in a mortal body, which was like ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fleſh, (and differed nothing from it, ſave only in innocence) and that on purpoſe that he might be a Sacrifice for Sin; and by laying our Sins on him, ſhewed a great Example of his Wrath againſt all carnal Sins, by puniſhing Sin in his fleſh, that ſo Men might be perſwaded by Love, or wrought on by Terrors, to forſake their ſinful Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this means Sin itſelf is condemned in our fleſh, that is, deſtroyed as to its guilt and power, which before by the Law had condemned us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh,


<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>4</label> but after the Spirit.</hi> By this means, namely, the ſending Chriſt to die, and giving us the Goſpel, which diſcovers to us his Death and Reſurrection, and the ends of them, we are perſwaded (the Spirit working together with it in the Preaching of it) to betake ourſelves to Chriſt for Pardon and Salvation, and for Strength againſt every Luſt of the Fleſh; and being truly converted by and to the Faith of the Goſpel, the Righteouſneſs of the Law comes to be fulfilled in us, and we are enabled, through the Grace of God, to do the ſubſtance of all that which the Moral Law requires; and our Failings are hid by the Interceſſions of Chriſt, and we are truly ſaid to walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</p>

I have not, that I know, balked or avoid d any thing in the whole Chapter that looks like an Argument for the Opinion which I contradict: And, that I may not be alone is this Diſcourſe, I thought it convenient to ſubjoyn, out of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Commentary, what were his Sentiments upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject debated; which after I have tranſcribed, I ſhall willingly follow the Apoſtle's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, throughout the whole eighth Chapter. For that therein (as I humbly conceive) the Apoſtle purſues the Myſtery of the Law of the Spirit of Life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, till he makes it evident, that this new Law, otherwiſe truly called Goſpel and the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, carries a Man on not only to a freedom from the Law of Sin and Death, or the bondage and power of Corruption, but carries him through the whole courſe of mortification of Sin, and vivification even of our natural Fleſh, bringing it on to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Spirit, the Spirit of our Mind, or the Law of the Mind, and indeed into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the Conduct of the Spirit of God; it brings us on to a Spirit of Adoption, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God with holy Boldneſs, as a Father. It carries us on through the heavieſt Sufferings, and teacheth us not only to call them, but account them light; it teacheth us to live by Faith and Hope; it teacheth us, laſtly, fully to acquieſce in the holy Will, good Will and Favour of God, as unconquerable and invulnerable, and makes us to tryumph in God, and in our Lord Jeſus, as inſeparable from his Love by all that can befal us here; and ſo makes us the glory of Chriſt here, by bearing and doing all for him, which muſt needs end in being glorified with him in the Heavens.</p>

Why, what is this carnal mind? Here I muſt make a grand Enquiry, that we may find out (if it ſo pleaſe God) what this carnal mind is; for if we know not the Subject ſpoken of, we can never well underſtand what that is which is predicated, or affirmed, and aſſerted of it; at leaſt not the manner how it is affirmed of it: For, <hi>non entis nulla ſunt attributa,</hi> and <hi>non eſſe, &amp; non apparere idem est.</hi> What then is meant by the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, what is the Mind of the Spirit, when it maketh Interceſſions for us within us; and doubtleſs there the meaning is what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would have. So here, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is what the Fleſh would have, the reliſh, ſavour or tendency of the Fleſh. What is this that is here called Fleſh, which hath in it ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſuch a tendency, ſuch a reliſh, ſuch a ſavour, as neither is nor can be ſubject to the Law of God? Till this Queſtion be well anſwered, till this Enquiry be prudently and ſatisfactorily made, I deſpair of ever giving a right Paraphraſe or Interpretation of this Verſe, or any of the like nature. <hi>Caro,</hi> ſaith <hi>Vorſtius, est Vitioſitas nativa ſeu peccatum Originis, a quo nihil boni cogitari &amp; praeſtari potest;</hi> and this Mr. <hi>Pole</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis</hi> leaves for the meaning of it. Now this I cannot acquieſce in as a full deſcription of the Subject Fleſh, here ſpoken of, there is ſomething of the truth in it, but it is not ſatisfactory. That it cannot be meant of ſinful fleſh, or a principle or root in us, that unavoidably carries ſin in it, or produceth ſin, ſeems apparent to me, from the Expreſſion of the Apoſtle in the latter end of this Verſe, <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> The Apoſtle makes a great aſſertion, That the carnal mind is enmity againſt God; then he gives a reaſon, Becauſe it is not ſubject to the Law of God: and then follows this reaſon, with an high proof or aggravation, which makes the reaſon very full and evident, That it is not only actually not ſubject, but incapable of becoming ſubject, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, neither indeed can be. Now, to me, it would be no wonder, no high diſcovery at all, to ſay, That a ſinful nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſubject to the holy Law; for every body knows, that that which hath ſin neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in it, cannot be ſubject to that which is holy; for there is a perfect contradiction in one to the other. But now if there be ſuch a thing which by nature is indifferent to ſin or not to ſin, but by accidental circumſtances becomes ſinful, and whil'ſt it is under thoſe accidents and circumſtances cannot but be a ſinning Principle and productive of variety of ſins; to aſſert concerning his, that whil'ſt under theſe circumſtances, it cannot be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God. This may be a great diſcovery, and worth our beſt and ſtricteſt notice and obſervation. Now ſuch a thing I take the fleſh, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be in this Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle's. We know, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are the two contradiſtinct and conſtituent parts of Man: <hi>Tee ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak,</hi> Matth. 26.41.

                  </gap>.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23.</note> Now there was a time when Fleſh and Spirit did ſweetly agree in the Service of God, and the Fleſh was without ſin: But ſince <hi>Adam</hi> fell, there was a ſad divorce made between the Fleſh and the Spirit of a Man, and every ſinner and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſon adheres to his fleſhly part, with the neglect of the Soul and Spirit, or Mind and Conſcience, and is led by the inclinations and tendencies of the Fleſh; and ſo the Fleſh in them is deſerted of its Guide, the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, it hath loſt its Bridle, and now the Fleſh
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95608:20"/>gives the denomination to a carnal Man. Nay, the Fleſh (that is, as deſtitute of its Guide, which ought to be the Spirit of a Man, enlightned and aſſiſted by the Spirit of God) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of a ſinning Principle, and partly in the Saints themſelves, for that none of them is perfect: So you have it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth against the ſpirit, and the ſpirit against the fleſh, and theſe two are contrary the one to another, ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</hi> Now Men, that are wholly unregenerate, are wholly under the command of their fleſhly inclinations, and they follow the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which the Fleſh dictates and commands, and this is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be; that is, whil'ſt they remain carnal: till they have received the Goſpel, they are in the fleſh, and walk after the fleſh. Nay, there is a further piece of myſtery in this matter, that whereas the Fleſh (according to the order of Nature, and inſtitution of God in our firſt Creation) ought to be influenced and guided and ruled by the Spirit; in carnal Men, the Fleſh influenceth and infecteth their very Mind and Conſcience, which is the only Fort and Garriſon that God holdeth in a wicked Man: Therefore we hear of a fleſhly Mind, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. And there even their Minds and Conſciences are defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. So that the ſence of this ſeventh Verſe ſeems now ſomewhat clear to me, wherein the Apoſtle proves what he had aſſerted in the ſixth, That to be carnally minded is death; namely, becauſe it is enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. And therefore what wonder is it, that it brings on a ſpiritual Death; whereas, on the contrary, to be ſpiritually minded, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is Life and Peace. When a Man hath entertained the Goſpel, and therewithal received the Spirit of God into his Heart, he is alive to God, and full of Peace and Joy.</p>
               <p>I might add one thing more, which may poſſibly elucidate this matter, and that is this: The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the tendency and ſtrong bent of the Fleſh, or the Fleſh itſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of the Spirit of a Man and of God, is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be; becauſe the Fleſh is not the immediate Subject of Religion any more than a Brute is; the brute Animals are not under any Rule of Religion; the Body is but the Soul's <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> its inferiour Aſſociate, it is not capable of ſeeing any Beauty or goodneſs in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but when the Mind is convinced and brought over to God, the Fleſh may and will joyn with the Soul, its ancient Friend and Guide, even in all its faculties and appetites, ſo long as it is well watcht and guided and prudently provided for; accordingly the Apoſtle adviſeth his good, holy, ſanctified Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortal body,</hi> (or fleſh) <hi>that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that ye ſhould obey it, that is, Sin in the luſts or deſires of it, that is, the mortal Body, as I have diſcourſed at large in the ſixth Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Paraphraſe therefore of this Verſe is this: The carnal Mind, (or rather the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and humor or mind of the Fleſh) deſerted of the conduct of the Spirit, hath ſet up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt againſt God,
<note place="margin">Thence we have it in <hi>Greek, Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi>

               <p>

               <p>By Adoption and Redemption, is here meant, the declaring our Adoption and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the full enjoyment of both; and this all Saints (when themſelves) do groan after. For it is certainly an eſſential part of the new Creature, to have at times, if not frequently, a deſire to be diſſolved, that they may be with Chriſt; for ſeeing God hath made that their happineſs, and they have made it their own choice; when they act like themſelves, they muſt needs, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> have a deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt: and the only reaſon of a Saint's deſiring to live here, ſhould be, that he may glorifie God; for by Faith he hath made a diſcovery of a far better ſtate than that of this Life can be: and this he muſt needs deſire far more than to live here, or he is abſurd.</p>

All true Saints have the Spirit of Grace and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they are enabled ſome way to pray for what they ought, and as they ought; and they have Groans that follow their Petitions, that have a meaning in them, that God only knows; no Man can conceive of the workings of their Hearts and Affections, ſo as God the ſearcher of the Heart underſtands them: For thither it is ultimately reſerred by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>He that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the ſpirit,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. We have ſpoken ſomewhat to that Phraſe in the 5th, 6th and 7th Verſes of this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95608:23"/>Chapter, Whether it be the Mind of our Spirit in its groanings, which comes not forth into words, or rather, what is the Mind of his own Spirit, becauſe it maketh Interceſſions for the Saints according to the Will of God. The Mind and Meaning of the Spirit anſwers to the Will of God, and therefore is ſo acceptable to him. But whoſe ſhall be the Groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Will any one aſcribe theſe to the Spirit, as groaning? I queſtion the Divinity of ſuch an Aſcription. Therefore the Groanings are made in the Saints, and actually exerted or groaned by the Saints, only guided and effected by the Spirit it ſelf dwelling in them: If ſo, then the Interceſſion that is made for us with theſe Groanings, is not only made for us in Heaven, but in us on Earth; therefore we are taught what to pray for, and how to pray by the Spirit, which makes theſe Interceſſions for us within us, of which God, who ſearcheth the Hearts, judgeth according to what of the Spirit is in them. I cannot here deſcend to ſpeak to the Controverſie of Praying by Forms, or without Forms; I think we may pray in the Holy Ghoſt (as the Phraſe is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18.) with a Form; and I queſtion not at all, but many good Miniſters and private Chriſtians pray in the Holy Ghoſt without a Form: And that is all I have to ſay at preſent, Only both ways you ſee that the ſanctified perſon in this Chapter hath this fifth Priviledge to be aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt; in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Prayers and Supplications to God, he doth not only groan within himſelf for the glory to come, for the hope which yet he doth not ſee, but the Spirit it ſelf helpeth him in his Groanings, and to his groanings, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the Spirit helps with us and over againſt us at the other end of the burden under which we groan, becauſe of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, which elſe would cauſe that the burthen would be too heavy for us: <hi>Onus attollit ex altera parte ne ſub eo fatiſcamus. Cum multa potuiſſet opera Spiritus Sancti proferre, quibus ab ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo juvamur, hoc ſolum exponit, eum adjuvare nos in orando,</hi> Tol. Therefore it is not his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us in Heaven. <hi>Spiritus Sanctus hic ut in praeced. membro intelligitur,</hi> E. Tol. Be. <hi>Qui interpellare dicitur non quod apud Patrem aut filium (ut perverſe dicebant Arriani) ſit Mediator, ſed quod efficaci ſua in nobis operatione nos orare faciat &amp; doceat,</hi> Menochius ex Eſtio, Pole in loc. <hi>Quia nos ad preces inſtigat,</hi> Beza. <hi>Quia preces ad Deum nobis dictat,</hi> Grotius, Beza. <hi>Poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat Spiritus non in ſe, ſed in nobis &amp; per nos tanquam per inſtrumenta rationalia &amp; libera: quod au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem per inſtrumentum fit, ipſi moventi cauſae primae tribuitur,</hi> Tolet.

There are many rare things in <hi>Pole</hi>'s Quotations, which are too long to be here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and tranſlated: I ſhall add a few more, and then tranſlate them, becauſe this is an important Matter.

The Engliſh of ſome of thoſe Latin Quotations above is this: Whereas he might have mentioned many Works of the Spirit, by which we are helped of it, he only inſiſts upon this, That he helped us in Praying. It is the Holy Spirit himſelf who is here to be underſtood, who is ſaid to make interceſſion; not that he is a Mediator with the Father or the Son, (as the <hi>Arrians</hi> falſly ſaid) but that by his effectual operation in us he makes and teaches us to pray, <hi>Menochius</hi> out of <hi>Eſtius.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he urges to pray, <hi>Beza.</hi> Becauſe he dictates to us Prayers which we are to offer to God, <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> The Spirit makes Interceſſions not in himſelf, but in us and by us as rational and free Inſtruments.

I am much taken with that Heathen Sentence, <hi>Nullum numen abest ſi ſit prudentia;</hi> I know not that we may act in any thing towards Man, much leſs in our Addreſſes to God, beyond what we underſtand. Once more thoſe Groanings are unutterable to us, not to God; God knoweth whither the heart is carried, being moved by the Holy Ghoſt, what the Spirit intends or means and aſks by us, <hi>Tolet.</hi> The Spirit intercedes, aſks, prays, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Saints who are his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whoſe hearts he moves, excites, and governs: God knows what the Spirit means, <hi>viz.</hi> to direct the Prayers of the Saints according to God, by ſuggeſting to them thoſe things to be prayed for, which may ſerve for the glory of God. <hi>Grotius</hi> in <hi>Pole's Synopſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have inſiſted the larger upon this Text and Matter, becauſe I find a ſtrange Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words in a Learned and Reverend Authour; wherein, he carries all this Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Prayer, to the
<q>Spirit of Chriſt's interceding and praying for us, at the Right Hand of his Father, where he always makes Interceſſion for us: So that when we Pray, but know not ourſelves what is beſt, nor conſequently what we ought to pray for, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, Health, Wealth, or Honour; then Chriſt joyns his helping Hand to ours, joyns his All-wiſe and Divine Prayers (for that which he knows we moſt want) to our Prayers, and ſo helps to relieve us in all our Diſtreſſes. <hi>And he that ſearcheth the hearts,</hi> &amp;c. Paraphraſe, and then God that knoweth our wants, exactly underſtands alſo the deſire and intention of the Spirit of Chriſt.—</q> This Interpretation you ſee is contrary to the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Expoſitors both Popiſh and Proteſtant, <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and turns theſe two Verſes which carry ſo much matter of Support and Conſolation in them, only upon the Interceſſion, of Chriſt in Heaven, which indeed is a moſt Comfortable Article of our Faith: but why ſhould we be robb'd and deſpoiled of the Comfort of the Advocate on Earth, which our Lord hath ſent us to ſupply his abſence from us, by making Interceſſion within us, as he doth without us moſt effectually at his Father's Right Hand? I meet with one that ſays upon this Paraphraſe theſe words:
<q>Thoſe that ſay that by <hi>the ſpirit that helpeth our infirmities</hi> Ver. 26. is meant Chriſt by his Spirit praying for us in Heaven, can neither make it agree with the Context, nor prove that the Spirit groaneth in Heaven,] or is called our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor there, but within us.</q> And ſo I paſs to the 28 Verſe.</p>

               <p>After the Apoſtle had reckoned up, and inſiſted upon theſe five ſeveral Priviledges, which the ſanctified Perſon is inveſted with, he ſeems to come in a general way to conclude, that not only all theſe things mentioned, but all other things whatſoever do work together for good, to them that love God. The whole Creation groans for their Deliverance, they Groan within themſelves for their glorious State, and the Spirit helps them in their Groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to further Groanings in Prayer beyond all Words and Expreſſions, even to meanings which God knows, and God alone; and they ſhall all be anſwered in full Returns, not a Sigh or a Groan loſt, ſent out from them that love God, from them that are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called according to his purpoſe.

Onely I muſt here honeſtly offer my Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this moſt profound-Matter, for I would deal honeſtly with all the World, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with the Church of God: And my chief Obſervation upon this Golden Chain, (as it is well called) is this: That the firſt Link of the Chain which is faſtened to the Mercy-ſeat (and all the World can never looſe it thence) is fore-knowledge, <hi>whom he did fore-know,</hi> which I humbly conceive is meant of God's fore-ſight,
<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>And ſo I diſmiſs the great Subject of theſe two Verſes, only I ſhall remark upon the 29th Verſe: <hi>Whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born amongst many brethren.</hi> That though Men have a true liberty of will in their choice of, and adhering unto Chriſt, yet God did not leave the whole iſſue and ſucceſs of things to the liberty of Men; but fore-ſeeing what Men would do, purpoſed and decreed to do more for them infinitely than they could themſelves do in carrying on the work of Grace in them; ſo that Chriſt ſhould not be an Head without a Body, and a Firſt-born without Brethren, but the Firſt-born amongſt many Brethren: And this fore-knowledge of God, what Men would do in believing and returning to God, is as eaſie for us to conceive of, as it is how God ſhould foreſee that <hi>Adam</hi> would certainly fall, when it was in his power to have ſtood; and yet this certain fore-knowledge of God muſt be allowed in a matter perfectly free, (for ought that we know) or elſe the purpoſe of ſending Chriſt as a Saviour, which was the <gap reason="foreign">

And then for the Comforts of Religion, though I doubt not but many well inclined and (I hope) truly religious People, have their doubts and fears of their good Eſtate to God-ward, yet I think, that ordinarily the ſadneſs of truly religious People, proceeds chiefly from their own neglect of their watch, and for that they are to little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with themſelves and their ſtate; for a truly godly Man nath abundant matter of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95608:25"/>Joy lying fairly before him, to take comfort and rejoyce in, and therefore it is made a great Duty by the Apoſtle to rejoyce in the Lord always, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. And Chriſtians live far below themſelves, when they live a drooping and a ſad life; indeed no other perſon in the World hath any true cauſe of joy, which yet every Saint hath; and in this Chapter is expreſſed the greateſt Aſſurance and richeſt Joy that you can find in all the Writings in the World; it far exceeds the Stoick's Apathy, and the Epicure's Tranquillity, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth to a Joy unſpeakable and glorious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. and that upon a good ground and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; no leſs than that of being utterly divorced from all evil, and united in affection and practice to all that is good; upon the firm promiſe of acceptance with God at preſent, through the Death and Interceſſions of his only begotten Son, and of Aſſiſtance from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to do the whole Will of God acceptably, and of Eternal Life after Death: And this ground of Comfort and Eſtabliſhment every good Man and Woman hath, though they do, not as they might and ought, make the diſcovery of it to themſelves.</p>

                  </note> ſhall be by way of humble Addreſs to the Preachers and Miniſters of the Word, That in their Sermons and particular Dealings or Treating with Perſons whoſe Conſciences are ſomewhat awakened to a ſence of Sin and Guilt, and to take ſome care of their Souls, they be very wary how they ſend Men to the Law, by bidding and charging them only to reform their Lives, and amend their Ways, and leave their wicked Courſes. 'Tis very true, it is their duty ſo to do; but you ſee in the ſeventh of the <hi>Romans</hi> throughout, what an ill effect this Advice or this Undertaking alone, without Chriſt, had upon the ſinner; it only killed him ſo much the more, and ſet all his Luſts a raging, and in an uproar, <hi>Fain he would do good, but evil was preſent with him:</hi> And wicked ſin, deceitful ſin, wrought death in him, by that which was holy, juſt and good, which made ſin appear to be malignant to an Hyperbole. And while he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his greateſt Struggle and War againſt Sin, only by vertue of the Law's prohibition of Sin, the Law of the Members made a more brisk reſiſtance, and conquered him and brought him into captivity to the Law of Sin. The Holineſs and Threatnings of the Law, may be of excellent uſe to terrifie them, but the Holineſs of the Law alone will never teach them and perſwade them to be holy. I humbly adviſe all the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, that deſign the ſalvation of Souls, that they do not only charge Men that come to them for advice, to leave their wickedneſs, and to be good and religious; though this be good and neceſſary advice; much leſs, as the fooliſh Papiſts do, to impoſe ſuch and ſuch Penances, which is the high way to provoke their Luſts, as ſoon as ever their Penances are over: but that they take all the care they can, when they ſee them in earneſt in Religion, to inſtruct them in the Doctrine of the Goſpel; That though they are great ſinners, and have ſo and ſo tranſgreſſed the Commands of God, (and a very particular Confeſſion of Sin enjoyned them, if not to their Spiritual Guide, (as was done to <hi>John the Baptist</hi>) yet at leaſt to their God, is very uſeful, and I think neceſſary; as ſearching the Wound is in order to a Cure; and eſpecially a ſenſe of the ſinfulneſs of their corrupt Nature, and there may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Directions neceſſary for many particular Caſes) yet, I ſay, they are to be inſtructed, That though they have ſo and ſo tranſgreſſed the Commands of God, yet they muſt not think they can make amends to God for what they have done amiſs, or come to do the Will of God in their own ſtrength, or ever come up to a full perfect unerring Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this Life: But that they muſt ſeriouſly conſider the Redemption that Chriſt hath wrought for them, by the ſacrifice of himſelf, and that their only courſe is to believe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt for ſinners; and ſo to give up themſelves to Chriſt, to be his ſervants; and pray to Chriſt, and to God in Chriſt, for his Spirit, to enable them to leave off all Sin, and exerciſe themſelves unto Godlineſs in all the parts and inſtances thereof: And that whileſt they do faithfully endeavour to leave every Sin, and to get every good habit and diſpoſition of Honeſty, Sobriety, Purity, Juſtice, Charity and Godlineſs in the Strength of God, they are accepted of God, through the Death and Interceſſions of Chriſt. This Spirit of Faith and Love, which are in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.23. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. can only ſet them free from the Law of Sin and Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95608:25"/>It is worthy of an excellent Pen, to expreſs theſe things more at large; but, I hope, I have in ſome ſatisfactory manner, ſignified the Neceſſity of this Courſe to be taken with Men, ſince the Apoſtle makes ſo much of it in his ſeventh Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> what ill effect the Law hath upon convicted ſinners, when they ſeek a Remedy from it only under their Convictions.</p>
               <p>And that the Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>When the law came,</hi> &amp;c. is plainly meant of the Moral Law, which is perpetual and everlaſting, binding the Conſcience of every Man and Woman in the World, and not only the Ceremonial Law (which (I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) the Jews much boaſted in, and ſought Juſtification by the obſervation of) were very eaſie to be demonſtrated. So far I had written, as the end of this Uſe, when a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friend of mine, to whom I communicated my Papers for his cenſure of them, adviſed me to evidence this Aſſertion, That the Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>When the law came,</hi> &amp;c. is plainly meant of the Moral Law, which I am loth here to fall upon the proof of, becauſe I would not willingly interrupt my proceeding to the Uſes which I am yet to make of the foregoing Diſcourſe, and therefore ſhall caſt it into an Appendix at the Concluſion.</p>
               <p>In the third place, I addreſs my ſelf to the Deiſts of the Age we live in.

                     <hi>By way of Conviction.</hi>
                  </note> We have indeed a great many Atheiſts, and more perhaps than ever were in any Age, the Lord be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us: But there are a ſort of better natured and more civil Perſons, that abhor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, as contrary to the Light of Nature, and the Intereſt of all Government and Civil Society itſelf. For that there can be no truſt in any Man, where there is no obligation upon Conſcience, but every Man is left to act as he judgeth it convenient to his preſent intereſt; I ſay, there is a ſort of Men, that acknowledge a God and Providence, and the reality of Moral Good and Evil, Juſt and Unjuſt; but they ſuſpend their Belief of the Goſpel, and they are apt to applaud themſelves and think themſelves in a very good condition, if they live honeſtly and vertuouſly, and depend upon God's Providence for protection in the way of Vertue; and conclude it ſhall all go well with them hereafter. But how far are theſe removed from the ſtrict obſervation of the workings of their own Hearts, which we find in this 7th and 8th Chapters to the <hi>Romans?</hi> They ought not only to acknowledge the Law of Nature, which no queſtion they find (ſome of them at leaſt) written in their Hearts, according to what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writes in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. But they ought to find how hard it is to keep the Law; how this Law convinceth them of Sin; and then, when they think to amend their ways, and to do good, how they are plunged by it into more Sin; and the more ſtrict they are upon themſelves, and the more rigidly they deal with themſelves towards mortification of any Extravagancy, the more they ſhall find their Luſts enraged, or perhaps fall into another extreme Vice. For I queſtion not but it might be demonſtrated by an able Pen, That all ſeeking to mortifie Luſts by the Law, only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and condemning, will in the end make the better ſide the worſe; and though Men may be as it were alive without the Law, and enjoy themſelves very pleaſantly, yes when they come ſtrictly to call themſelves to account for their Actions, Intentions, Rules, Conduct and Management of themſelves, as under the Law of God, and ſeek in earneſt to reform themſelves by the Law, they ſhall raiſe ſuch a Confuſion, Combuſtion, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, as ſhall make them almoſt diſtracted and deſperate. The Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s the moſt rigid School-maſter that ever the World had; it laſheth Men with Scorpions; it kills them with a thouſand Deaths; it makes them weary of their Lives: No wonder then at the Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> And after this cloſe Preſs they have been in, which will make them ſwear even drops of Blood, they ſhall never attain to any true reſt, till they come to ſay, <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus Christ my Lord.</hi> I pity much theſe ingenious, civil and half-vertuous Gentlemen, that think they have made great Attainments in Religion, by coming to acknowledge, That there is a God, and, Athenian-like, are ſtill inquiring after ſome innocent new Diſcoveries in Nature or the Politicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they little think of their rumbling into Hell, for want of going further on in Religion. For if Chriſt came from Heaven to ſatisfie the Law, and to make a new and living Way to God in his own Blood, he will not ſuffer himſelf to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95608:26"/>ſo neglected by the Gentile ſecure Deiſt, as not to be ſo much as inquired after, how and which way he is to be a Saviour; that they muſt ſee they have offended the Law, and are condemned by the Law, and have no Refuge but in him, who anſwered the Law, and that they muſt change their old Huſband and Maſter, and get their Mind quiet and at reſt only by believing in him, loving him, going to him for ſtrength to fulfil the Law, that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law may be fulfilled in them, walking not after the Fleſh, but-after the Spirit. Theſe alery unconcerned ſpeculative Gentlemen have a great work to do, which they are not aware of; for I dare boldly advance this Propoſition, (though amongſt Divines it is no bold Aſſertion, but amongſt Gentlemen it may be thought ſo,) That whoſoever under the clear preaching of the Goſpel, as now it is in our Land, doth not eſteem Jeſus Chriſt more precious than his Life, and all his Worldly Intereſts, yea, of greater benefit to him by his Death and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, than all his Moral Excellencies, ſhall be condemned at laſt to Hell, for ſlighting the Gift of God, in giving his Son to be the only Saviour. Such perſons may be excellent Commonwealths Men, good Subjects to any Soveraign; good, that is, in ſome ſence good Friends and Neighbours, but they will be never admitted for Saints into the Kingdom of Heaven, and therefore let them look to themſelves in time: <hi>As for theſe mine enemies, that would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me;</hi> ſaith our Saviour in the Parable, meaning it of himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27.</p>
               <p>By way of Addreſs to the Philoſophers of the Age, which are not a few, and withal as penetrating,


<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>IV</label> profound and comprehenſive as perhaps any Age in the World ever ſaw, the learned Ages of <hi>Athens, Chaldea</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> not excepted: You take great delight in the ſearch of Wiſdom, and indeed it is worthy of Men ſo to do, far more worthy than to heap up Riches, or to enlarge Empire and Dominion, though by fair means; yet I am much of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s mind, of whom I have ſeveral times read, that he was chiefly for Moral Philoſophy, how a Man ſhould guide his Actions and his Thoughts. Now in my mind this diſcourſe of the Apoſtle concerning the advance of true Holineſs, which I verily believe the honeſt Philoſophers aimed at, under the name of Virtue, is as acute and profound, as practical and experimental, as any Diſcourſe that ever was framed by Man, and it hath this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all other Philoſophical Diſcourſes, That though (as I humbly conceive) it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged really with the Apoſtle's Reaſon and with his humane Underſtanding; yet was his Pen guided all along by the holy Spirit; and the three conjoyned Chapters of 6, 7, and 8, to the <hi>Romans</hi> is a Compleat Syſtem of Moral Philoſophy.</p>

And I humbly conceive this was the meaning of the Apoſtle, We ſpeak that which hath a good conſonancy and harmony and agreement in itſelf, with all the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Man. And indeed, though I have been formerly, when I was a Child in Years, and a very Novice in Knowledge, (though now I do not pretend to any great ſtrength, yet perhaps, through the Grace of God I may know a little) but though, when I was a meer beginner, I was affrightned by many from uſing Reaſon in Religion; yet for more than Thirty Years I have made bold in my ſmall reading and Speculation to uſe my Reaſon, which I do heartily acknowledge to be very ſmall: And though I am not of the Socinian Principle, (as it is generally ſaid of them, that 'tis theirs) that we are not to believe any thing that our Reaſon cannot comprehend; yet I am not for believing any thing, but what we have reaſon o believe: But then I think it reaſon enough to believe any thing to be true, if I have reaſon to believe, that it is revealed by God. And I think it is the greateſt honour we can do to God, to uſe our utmoſt reaſon in underſtanding what he hath revealed, and, as far as we may, to endeavour to perceive the <gap reason="foreign">

The means of attaining it is vertuous or holy practice; now the means again of attaining to this ability of vertuous Practice, the Stoicksſay, is the cutting off, or mortifying the paſſions or affections, which ſome have truly ſaid is the cutting off the legs or wings which we ſhould go or fly upon, and turning a Man into a Stock; the Peripateticks ſay, with more reaſon, the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of the paſſions is the better way. But alas! all the Queſtion lyes here: How ſhall we come to moderate the paſſions? The Apoſtle tells you, with a great deal of truth, That if you go to the Law, which is the Rule of Duty to all the World, and try to get any affection mortified (ſaith the Stoick), regulated (ſaith the Peripatetick), it will enrage all your evil inclinations, and make them more rampant and mad than ever they were before. You might remain alive, and be pretty quiet, and have a good Opinion of yourſelf, and obtain a good eſteem with others, if you would not come too near the unalterable Rule of Holineſs and true Virtue; but if once you come ſtrictly near that, and compare yourſelf with it, and obſerve your aberrations from it, and then try to reform by it that you may anſwer the Pattern of it, you ſhall only ſtill find that it will convince you and condemn you, and at laſt make you weary, and make you mad, and fill you with deſpair. You may chance find the Cittadel of Conſcience, and the mind hold out for the Law and for God, that is, in its bare Vote, but the City and Country round, the Affections and Body, every limb and every faculty ſhall revolt and deſert, and do what they pleaſe, and yield no obedience; you ſhall find at length no more conformity to the Rule, than the raging which <hi>Medea</hi> had by her <hi>Video meliora probo<expan>

If we walk according to this Rule, To do all to the Glory of God, and in dependance upon him, giving Thanks for ſo great a Saviour, peace ſhall be upon us, as upon the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. If we are guilty of Negligence, we muſt preſently go to God by Prayer, confeſs our ſins, charge ourſelves honeſtly, ſeverely, bitterly, according to the neglect; but we muſt not deſpond, but endeavour to double our Diligence and Watchfulneſs. In this way God hath the true Glory of an hearty Obedience; the Law of God is no whit diſhonoured; for we bid not the leaſt defiance, deny no Duty of Conformity to it, but we are free from the danger of its Condemnation, being ſecured by a Surety and Advocate. Thus the Righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit. And whilſt we remain faithful to our God in this way of fincere conſtant uniform Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we have free Acceſs to God as a Father.

I ſhall give no further proof of this at preſent, than the foregoing Diſcourſe, which I have thought neceſſary, or at leaſt convenient to make; in which, I hope, I have made it appear, That the ſeventh Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> is not to be underſtood of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as in his rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Eſtate, but as under legal Convictions; or rather, of a third perſon, perſonated in the firſt, which is ſo far from being rightly underſtood, that perhaps the greater half of Divines underſtand it of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf: So ſubtile an evil is that of Legality, or ſeeking to be juſtified by the Law, that it cannot eaſily be underſtood in the cleareſt Goſpel-light: But, <hi>Qui bene diſtinguit bene docet;</hi> and if any Monopoly be fit to be claimed by an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, I humbly conceive it is that of Diſtinctions. Your Students are taught learned and polite Ethicks: but if they be not taught how to avoid the Condemning Power of the Law by the Grace of the Goſpel, the Law will condemn them. If they be not well warned of the enraging irritating force of the Law (occaſionally) upon all their Luſts, when they ſeek to be reformed by it alone, that which was ordained unto Life will be found Death unto them; and Sin taking occaſion from the Commandment, will work in them all manner of Concupiſcence and Sin, that it may appear Sin, working Death in them by that which is good, will by the Commandment become out of meaſure ſinful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10.8.13.</p>

If thoſe that endeavour in ſome ſeriouſneſs and earneſt to reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Law, yet, for want of underſtanding the Grace of Chriſt, cannot attain unto true Holineſs and Peace; What Peace, what Comfort, belongs to thoſe that heed not either the Precepts of the Law, or the Promiſes of the Goſpel? What though they call themſelves Churchmen and Sons of the Church? What if they be of ſeparate Aſſemblies, if they walk not after the Spirit, but after the Fleſh, they are the Devil's Slaves, and Firebrands of Hell: <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked,</hi> Iſai. 48.22. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> Holineſs is the true end of all Religion; we muſt attain unto Holineſs, or

There is no communion with God, no Fellowſhip or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with or Approach unto God (for all theſe I take to be underſtood by Reaſoning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) without waſhing and cleanſing ourſelves. Before this in the 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Verſes, God renounceth all Acceptance of any thing they did in Religion: <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices unto me?</hi> &amp;c. ſaith the Lord. Men may uſe ſome kind of honeſt Endeavours after Holineſs, and fail of attaining what they ſeek after. Thus the Apoſtle witneſſes of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 9.31. <hi>But Iſrael which followed after the law of righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the law of righteouſneſs.</hi> Verſe 32. <hi>Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.</hi> Now for theſe the Apoſile had a great deal of Pitty and Commiſeration, as you may ſee Rom. 9.1, 2, 3. <hi>I ſay the truth in Christ, I lye not, my conſcience alſo bearing me witneſs in the Holy Ghost, that I have great hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, and continual ſorrow in my heart, For I could wiſh that myſelf were accurſed from Christ, for my brethren my kinſmen, according to the fleſh, who are Iſraelites,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo Rom. 10.1, 2, 3. <hi>Brethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved. For I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to the knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> Now I have made theſe two laſt Quotations, to prove, That Men may in ſome ſort and way have a great Zeal and Endeavour to pleaſe God, and to be the Favorites of Heaven, and yet loſe their labour. What ſhall become then of thoſe that take no pains in Religion at all? and indeed, do not truly endeavour to become univerſally Holy? but pleaſe themſelves with ſome poor low ends in their Profeſſion, ſhort of this only worthy deſign. I ſhall conclude this Application with thoſe words of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21, 22. <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> What real Profit, or what real Comfort had ye in thoſe ſinful Pleaſures and wicked Courſes wherein once (in the State of Unregeneracy) ye indulged yourſelves? Wicked Men of the World take a great deal of pains to get Profits, and Pleaſures, and Honours, and what doth it afford them? What comfort have they of it at the very time, upon a ſober Review and Conſideration? The Anſwer is, None at all; and beſides, now ye are aſhamed of what ye then did; then it was no matter of Comfort, and now 'tis a matter of Shame. But what follows, Ver. 22. <hi>But now being made free from ſin.</hi>— (Who is free from ſin?

Have they been couvinced of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95608:28"/>becauſe Chriſt is gone to the Father, and we are to ſee him no more, till his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, and from hence conclude, that he hath brought about Everlaſting Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by his Death? for elſe how could he, upon whom his Father laid the Iniquities of us all, and did, while he was puniſhing him upon the Croſs, (as it were) forſake him, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted again into his Father's preſence as an Advocate for us? Have they been convinced of Judgment, as knowing that becauſe Chriſt hath died, and is again gone to the Father, that therefore the Prince of this World (the Devil) is judged and condemned, and ſhall be caſt out of his Tyranny over Men all Men that betake themſelves to Chriſt, the Captain of their Salvation, who by Death deſtroyed him that had the power of Death, that is, the Devil, <hi>that he might deliver them, who, through fear of death, are all their life-time ſubject to bondage?</hi> Heb. 2.14, 15. And ſo have they betaken themſelves to Chriſt, as their Head and Husband and only Saviour, that he may be made of God unto them Wiſdom, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption?

And for this end you have a Suit of Spiritual Armour, the Armour of God on the Right-hand and on the left, from Head to Foot; and ye ſhall be made more than Conquerors, through him that hath loved you to the Death of the Croſs. Rejoyce in the Lord always; and again, I ſay, rejoyce. Read the eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and take Courage and Everlaſting Conſolation.

               <p>I will lead you to one rich Walk, where you may expatiate and deliciate your holy Souls: For I ſpeak here to none but thoſe that are ſanctified and effectually called: It is <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, to the 7th incluſive, <hi>Now I ſay, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a ſervant, though he be lord of all, but is under tutors and governors, until the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the father; even ſo we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: but when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> Under the times and diſpenſations of the Old Teſtament, till the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, the People of God, even the true Saints of God, were like Children, though great Heirs, kept at School, bred up at a diſtance from their Father's Houſe in a ſtate of darkneſs, fear and bondage, knew little of their Priviledges and Inheritance; tho' they were ſaved by Faith, and had the Goſpel preached to them in an obſcure way, yet it lookt all like Law, till Chriſt, the Eternal Son of God, was made of a Woman, and made under the Law, they alſo were (as it were) under the Law: But now, in the days of the Goſpel, eſpecially ſince the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and his Miſſion of the Spirit, the Diſpenſation is quite altered, and they are, like Heirs, called home to the poſſeſſion of their Inheritance, to live like thoſe that are Lords of all.

            <head>AN APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>THat the aſſertion of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>When the commandment came, ſin reviv'd, and I died,</hi> is plainly meant of the Moral Law, I ſhall now endeavour to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>For this I reckon, there are ſeveral proofs in this 7th Chapter to the <hi>Romans:</hi> Firſt, if we conſider to whom this Epiſtle was written, it was to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were certainly as much Gentiles as Jews, and more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.13. The Apoſtle tells them, <hi>I ſpeak to you Gentiles; foraſmuch as I am the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, I magnifie mine office.</hi> Now to theſe he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Wherefore my brethren, ye alſo are become dead to the law, by the body of Christ, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him that is raiſed from the dead,</hi> &amp;c. How could they become dead to the Law, that were never alive to it? or to whom the Law was never alive? For the Law was never alive to them, except the Moral Law written in the Heart. They were never under the Ceremonial Law, but under the Moral Law they were born, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the law: theſe having not the law, are a law unto themſelves:</hi> Verſe 15. <hi>Which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. The Ceremonial Law was not written in the Heart of Man. Therefore, here by Law, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 2d. Chapter, muſt be meant the Moral Law; and this was all they could ever be alive, or become dead to. 'Tis true, the <hi>Jews</hi> might be ſaid to become dead to the Ceremonial Law too, by the Body of Chriſt crucified: But this was as nothing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or mecr <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To leave then this Argument from the perſons to whom he wrote, (being <hi>Gentiles</hi>) and to ſpeak only to the nature of the thing, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. It is ſaid, <hi>For when we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſins which were by the law, did work,</hi> &amp;c. What motions of ſins can we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be wrought by the Ceremonial, or Judicial Law, more than, as they commanded Duties but gave no ſtrength to perform, which is the cauſe why the Moral Law wrought the ſame Effect? Doth there appear any peculiar reaſon for this Effect, from either of theſe Laws, which is not found in the Moral Law? Or, if there do, how doth this affect the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that were never under them?</p>
            <p>Again, Verſe 7. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? is the law ſin? God forbid: nay, I had not known ſin but by the law; for I had not known luſt, except the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> What Law ſaith this? Why it is the Tenth Commandment of the Moral Law. Therefore, it is the Moral Law that is the firſt Husband ſpoken of. Again, Verſe 8. <hi>But ſin taking occaſion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence: For without the law ſin is dead.</hi> Can all this be colourably ſaid of the Ceremonial Law, and not rather of the Moral Law? As it forbids all Sin, and commands all Duty, and gives neither Strength nor Pardon? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Ceremonial Law doth not command ſo much, and yet gives ſome intimations of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by the Sacrifices which it enjoys. Verſe 12. <hi>Wherefore the law is holy, and the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holy, and juſt, and good.</hi> I queſtion whether this can be Scripturally, and Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſpoken of the Ceremonial Law, which (in a Sence) is ſaid not to be good, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.25. <hi>Wherefore I gave them ſtatutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they ſhould not live,</hi> Dedi eis praecepta non bona, id eſt Praecepta Ceremonialia, <hi>ſaith</hi> Pole <hi>in Loc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95608:29"/>Verſe 14. <hi>For we know that the law is ſpiritual.</hi> This is truly ſaid of the Moral Law; but it ſaid of the Ceremonial Law, that it was a <hi>carnal commandment,</hi> Heb. 7.16. <hi>and</hi> Heb. 9 10. It is called <hi>carnal ordinances,</hi> Rites or Ceremonies. Again, Verſe 9. of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>For I was alive without the law once.</hi> Let us ſuppoſe, for the preſent, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks properly in his own Name. When was ever the Apoſtle alive without the Ceremonial, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, who was bred up at the ſtricteſt rate under them both as a Phariſee? The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore is, he was alive without the Law, that is, before the Law came with its preſſing Convictions; and what ſhall we imagine that theſe Convictions were? What? That the Ceremonial Law came with its Convictions? That he had neglected ſo many Waſhings and Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who ever underſtood it ſo? Is it not rather underſtood by all, that the Moral Law came in upon his Conſcience, as a ſpiritual and Holy Law, and the very Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of the Holineſs of God, and charged him with that, as Sin, which he never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be Sin before, as he inſtanceth in Luſt and Coveting, and ſo made him appear guilty before the Holy God, ſo as he could never hope to be accepted with God, without Pardon and a Saviour? And what other Law could this be, which ſhould be ſaid to come thus, but the Moral Law? That which <hi>was ordained to be Life to</hi> Adam, <hi>he found to be Death to him,</hi> being once (indeed) and ſo often broken by his firſt Parents and by himſelf.</p>
            <p>So by all theſe Texts out of the chief Chapter which I have (in the foregoing Diſcourſe) been explaining, I apprehend it is evident, That the Apoſtle ſpeaks chiefly, if not only, of the Moral Law. Therefore the Moral Law was their Husband which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <head>A Second APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>ANother of my worthy Friends, to whom I communicated my Manuſcript for his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, queſtioned whether it could be made to appear, that the Law did ſo much as accidentally enrage Luſt, and occaſion greater ſinning in thoſe that ſeek to be juſtified by the Law, and was inclined to think, that the Law did only aggravate the guilt of any Sin, and ſo wound the Conſcience; and that this ſhould be all the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>When the commandment came, ſin revived and I died; and the commandment which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death,</hi> Rom. 7.9, 10. But I am ſtill of opinion, that there is and muſt needs be a farther ſence in the words, and that when a Man ſeeks to be juſtified by the Law, (which is a Diſtemper very incident to Humane Nature, under divers ſhapes and forms, and the moſt ſubtile and unaccountable Diſeaſe of Mankind) the Law, inſtead of juſtifying, (which it can by no means effect) doth not only aggravate Sin, and kill a Man, as a Miniſtration of Condemnation, but doth (though accidentally, yet certainly) work in us all manner of Concupiſcence, and doth bring forth new Fruit unto Death, as well as diſcover the old; for which I think there are ſeveral very conſiderable Proofs in this ſeventh Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and I ſhall take them as they lye in order:</p>
            <p>Verſe 5. <hi>When we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſin which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. When we were in the fleſh,</hi> that is in a ſtate of Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, and ſo under the Law had not betaken ourſelves to Chriſt for an Husband, <hi>the motions of ſin did work.</hi> This methinks cannot be underſtood of Paſt-ſins, that we were then convinced of them by the Law, but they are Motions or Inclinations towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; ſo the Expreſſion is continued, <hi>they did work,</hi> in ordine ad, <hi>to bring forth fruit unto death.</hi> That is, towards new Commiſſions; and theſe Motions of Sin are ſaid to be by the Law. How can this be interpreted of laying on guilt, or charging us with guilt for Sins al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready committed? So accordingly the Antitheſis in the next Verſe ſeems to carry it.</p>
            <p>Verſe 6. <hi>But now we are delivered from the law,</hi> that did thus produce (and not only diſcover) Sin, <hi>that being dead wherein we were held,</hi> (that is the Law) <hi>that we ſhould ſerve in newneſs of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter;</hi> or as it is in Verſe 4. <hi>That we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> This part of the Antitheſis ſpeaks clearly of doing good Actions, therefore the other part of the Antitheſis muſt ſpeak of doing ill Actions, by bringing forth Fruit unto Death; for, <hi>Contrariorum Contrariae ſunt Rationes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. <hi>Sin, taking occaſion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence;</hi> 'tis one thing to work it, and another to diſcover it; ſo it follows, <hi>for without the law, ſin is dead;</hi> that is, (or ſeems to be) dead as to energy, not as to diſcovery or being made to appear, or becoming alive in its guilt only, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But let this 8th Verſe, and the 9th and 10th following, be taken in this ſence: For making the guilt of ſin to revive: Yet what ſhall we ſay to the 11th Verſe, <hi>For ſin taking occaſion by the commandment, deceived me?</hi> Firſt, this Phraſe, <hi>taking occaſion by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Arrepta occaſione inflammandi (per legen vetantem) concupiſcentiam,</hi> Vatablus in Pol. Verſu 8vo. <hi>Multi interpretes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> exponunt occaſionem putant<expan>
                     <am>

                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> idem dici quod vulgari proverbio intimur in Vetitum,</hi> Grotius in Pol. So that this taking occaſion by the Commandment, is by theſe Interpreters underſtood of taking an advantage towards new Commiſſions. 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Deceived me:</hi> How can ſin, (that is, indwelling ſin, or ſinful Inclinations) be ſaid to deceive, but as it had a kind of malicious Deſign (by a <hi>Proſopopaeia</hi> here) to draw the ſinning perſon farther into actual Commiſſions, by which alſo <hi>it ſlew him,</hi> not only by char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95608:30"/>the Guilts that had paſt, for that is the work of the Law to kill that way, by way of charge; and not the work of ſin or ſinful Inclination called Concupiſcence; ſin doth not charge home ſin upon the Conſcience, but Concupiſcence here called ſin promotes further Commiſions, <hi>ſeduxit me, i. e. in ſuas partes me doloſe traxit, ab errare me fecit, longius me ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxit a via juſtitiae; ad peccandum me pellexit,</hi> &amp;c. Menochius, Eſtius, Beza, in Pol. But methinks the 13 Verſe, plainly makes it appear, that ſin takes a great advantage towards ſtrengthening and promoting itſelf in the Sinner, or ſinful Perſon, by the Law, according to the <hi>Proſipopaea,</hi> wherein the Apoſtle makes ſin an Agent, and as it were a Perſon. <hi>Was that then which is good</hi> (that is the Law) <hi>made death to me? God forbid. But ſin that it might appear ſin,</hi> and ſhew itſelf in its Colours, <hi>working death in me, by that which is good, that ſin</hi> itſelf <hi>by the commandment might become out of meaſure ſinful.</hi> I would fain know what tolerable ſence can be made of theſe words, but that they muſt afford a plain proof of what I have been contending for? 'Tis true, 'tis ſence to ſay, that ſin by the Commandment appears to be ſin, becauſe it is forbidden by the Commandment, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 John 3.4. <hi>Every ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the law.</hi> And it is ſence to ſay, that ſin brings us to death by that which is good, that is the Law forbidding it; but how will this plain honeſt ſence bear all the heighth and heat and ſmartneſs of the Apoſtle's arguing in this Verſe, <hi>But ſin, that it might appear ſin working death in me by that which is good, that ſin by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment might become out of meaſure ſinful?</hi> Sin appears to be ſin by the Commandment, but how doth it appear out of meaſure ſinful? How doth this <hi>But</hi> come in? <hi>But ſin that it might appear ſin,</hi> namely for this Reaſon, for that it works death in me by that which is good. I ſay, how doth this <hi>But</hi> come in? 'Twill not bear a Diſcretive, to ſay only, that the Law threatens with Death a Man, that doth ſuch and ſuch things, and he ſinning or tranſgreſſing falls under this penalty; this is no wonder at all. How doth ſin appear out of meaſure ſinful, by this? How doth ſin ſhew ſuch extraordinary Venome in this? That it lays a Man under the penalty of the plain Law? But now if ſin that is indwelling-ſin or Concupiſcence hath ſuch a miſchevious deviliſh nature in it, that it doth not only lay us under the penalty of Death, but will therefore ſin becauſe ſin is forbidden, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore break the Law becauſe it forbids ſin, and take its very riſe and occaſion to all manner of Wickedneſs, and work in us all manner of Concupiſcence, from that which is holy, juſt and good, this ſhews ſin, and that by the Commandment to be a thing out of meaſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, this ſets forth ſin in its true Colours and ſhews it to be ſin indeed; a thing that cannot be decyphered by any worſe Name than it hath already, <hi>Sin that it might appear ſin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and out of meaſure ſinful.</hi>
